# The Other Philadelphia #

## Overview ##

This application was an entry for the 2012 Code for America
Philadelphia hackathon.  It retrieves a random sampling of your
Facebook friends and applies statistics about __unemployment__,
__violent crime__, __poverty__, and __graduation rate__ to them to
help you empathize with what it's like to live in certain
areas of Philadelphia.
